# Streamlit: A Fast Way to Build Data Apps

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) is an open-source Python library that allows you to build custom web applications for machine learning and data science projects with minimal effort.

## Key Features
- **Pure Python**: Write apps using just Python scripts. No need for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

st.title("Hello Streamlit")
st.write("This is a simple Streamlit app.")
st.line_chart({"data": [1, 5, 2, 6, 2, 1]})
```

## Use Cases
- Data exploration and visualization
- Machine learning model demos
- Real-time dashboards
- Internal tools

## Installation
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

## Running Your App
Save your script as `app.py` and run:
